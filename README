# Academic Calendar Scraper and ICS Exporter

This script automates the extraction of academic events from a university calendar web interface and exports them as `.ics` files (iCalendar format), organized by course code.

---

## Features

- Intercepts XMLHttpRequest responses to extract event data.
- Dynamically detects the active session identifier (pid).
- Parses and groups events by course code, extracting:
  - Course identifier from the caption
  - Start and end date/time
  - Room number (if available)
- Automatically clicks the "Next Week" button to navigate through the calendar interface.
- Filters events that fall within a specified date range (`START_DATE` to `END_DATE`).
- Exports each course's events to a separate `.ics` file, suitable for import into calendar applications like Google Calendar, Outlook, or Apple Calendar.

## How It Works

1. **Injection**: Paste the script into the browser console while viewing the academic calendar page.
2. **Monitoring**: The script listens for backend calendar data (XHR requests).
3. **Extraction**: It parses relevant data from each weekly response, collecting:
   - Date, time, caption, location, and course code
4. **Navigation**: Clicks through the calendar interface week by week until the defined end date is reached.
5. **Export**: When finished, the script generates `.ics` files and triggers downloads automaticallyâ€”one file per course.

## Configuration

At the top of the script, you can adjust the following:

```javascript
const START_DATE = new Date("2025-02-17");
const END_DATE = new Date("2025-07-25");
```

Modify these values to match your desired semester or date range.

## Output

- Files are named in the format: `course_<courseCode>.ics`
- Each file contains properly formatted `VEVENT` entries with:
  - `SUMMARY`: Original event caption
  - `DTSTART` / `DTEND`: Start and end timestamps
  - `LOCATION`: Extracted room number (if available)

---

## Requirements

- A modern browser (tested on Chrome and Firefox)
- Access to the university calendar platform that loads events via XHR
